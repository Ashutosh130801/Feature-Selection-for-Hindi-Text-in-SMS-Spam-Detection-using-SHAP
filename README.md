selecting the best feature set among the feature set before classification
Feature Selection for Hindi Text in SMS Spam Detection using SHAP sep 2024 - dec 2024
Tools: [Python, ML]
◦ Dataset Preparation: Collection and preprocessing of a labeled dataset of Hindi SMS messages (spam vs.
ham).
◦ Text Representation: Conversion of text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word
embeddings.
◦ Feature Selection Methods:
∗ Traditional methods: Chi-Square, Mutual Information, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
∗ Model-based methods: Feature importance from tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest)
∗ SHAP-based feature selection:Using SHAP values to identify and retain the most impactful features.
◦ Model Training and Evaluation: Building classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and
comparing performance using selected features from different methods.
◦ Result Analysis: SHAP consistently identifies more meaningful and semantically relevant features for Hindi
SMS classification, leading to improved model accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional
techniques.
